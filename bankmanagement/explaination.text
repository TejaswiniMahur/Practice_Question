Explanation
Encapsulation: The BankAccount class and its subclasses encapsulate their respective properties (accountNumber, balance, accountHolderName, interestRate, overdraftLimit) and provide public methods to interact with these properties, ensuring controlled access.

Inheritance: The SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount classes inherit from the BankAccount class, allowing them to reuse and extend its functionality.

Polymorphism: The withdraw method is overridden in the CurrentAccount class to provide additional behavior for overdraft limits, demonstrating polymorphism.

Abstraction: The BankAccount class serves as a general template for bank accounts, while SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount provide specific implementations for different types of accounts.

This code demonstrates the core principles of OOP in a simple banking system.
